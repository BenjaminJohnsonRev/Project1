# Project One
For Project One, you are required to build a REST API that satisifies the requirements set forth in the Expense Reimbursement Management System document. Your ERMS must abide by following:

## Technology

* RESTful API built with Servlets
* Unit testing with JUnit
* Data stored in PostgreSQL database

## Other

* Complete approval process
* Discrete Data Access layer
* At least 90% test coverage for the data and service layers
* All Data Structures used must be custom-implemented (no using Java Collections)
* Demonstrate API using Postman

You will have 5 minutes to demo this to me and the rest of the cohort.
